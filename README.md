# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Project

Project Title: Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset

Description:
This project involves the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The primary goals of the project were:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Loaded and explored the Iris dataset using pandas to understand its structure.
Utilized visualizations, including heatmaps, to analyze the correlation between different features.
Data Preprocessing:

Prepared the dataset by extracting feature variables and target variable.
Performed one-hot encoding on the categorical target variable.
Decision Tree Model:

Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
Visualized the confusion matrix to assess the performance of the classifier.
Decision Tree Visualization:

Generated and saved a visual representation of the trained Decision Tree Classifier.
Technologies Used:

Python
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning tasks
Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier for multi-class classification tasks. The visualization of the decision tree provides insights into the decision-making process of the model.
